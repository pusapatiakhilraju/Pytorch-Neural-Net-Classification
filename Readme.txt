<h1>Pytorch Fundamentals</h1>

1. Tensor - a algebraic object that describes a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects
2. scalar - is a algebraic object that has only magnitude. Scalar has 0 dimensions
3. vetor - It has both magnitude and direction. Number of closing square bracket is 1 dimension.
4. random tensors- torch.random()is used to generate random tensors. These are important because, most of the neural networks start with random numbers and adjust the numbers to better represent the data.
    example: start with random numbers - > look at data - > update random numbers - > look at data -> update
