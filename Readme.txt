Pytorch Fundamentals

1. Tensor - a algebraic object that describes a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects
2. scalar - is a algebraic object that has only magnitude. Scalar has 0 dimensions
3. vetor - It has both magnitude and direction. Number of closing square bracket is 1 dimension.
4. random tensors- torch.random()is used to generate random tensors. These are important because, most of the neural networks start with random numbers and adjust the numbers to better represent the data.
    example: start with random numbers - > look at data - > update random numbers - > look at data -> update
5. Zeros and Ones - These tensors can be used for masks
6. Like - Sometimes there might be a need to make a new tensor of the shape as an existing tensor. for such scenerios like is used. There are a few different type of like. Zeros_lie, full_like are a few examples.
7. Dtypes-  Even if the dtypes are given as none. The dtype of tensor will be float 32. 
8. while creating a tensor there are 3 different types of attributes. They are as follows
    dtype - to mention the data type
    device - It tells what device the tensor is on
    requires_grad = True/False - used to tradck gradient decent. This helps to track the performance of the neural network.
9. *IMPORTANT* Tensor datatype errors are of 3 types. These are common big errors that arise in Pytorch and deep learning. They are as follows:
    Tensor not right data type.
    Tensor not right shape
    Tensor not on right device
