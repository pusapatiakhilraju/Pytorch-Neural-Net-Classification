You're going to cover a standard PyTorch workflow (it can be chopped and changed as necessary but it covers the main outline of steps).
Process:
1. Get data read 
2. build or pick pre-trained model - > 2.1 pick loss function and optimiser - > 2.2 build training loop 
3. fit the model to data and make prediction 
4. evaluate model
5. improve through experimentation and fine tuning
6. save and reload the trained model
